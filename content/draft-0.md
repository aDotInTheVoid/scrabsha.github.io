Hi there! I am Sasha Pourcelot (she/her pronouns). I'm a student of Polytech
Nice Sophia, France, at the Computer Science department.

I enjoy programming in rust and cooking pizzas with my father.

My github handle is [@scrabsha][github-profile]. You can also find me on twitter
at [@scrabsha][twitter-profile] too. Finaly, you can send me a mail at
[sasha.pourcelot@protonmail.com][mail].

I have done some very small contributions to the rust compiler and written some
small and mostly-useless crates too.

Hi there! I am Sasha Pourcelot (she/her pronouns). I'm a CS student at Polytech
Nice Sophia, France.

I enjoy programming in Rust and cooking pizzas.

My GitHub handle is [@scrabsha][github-profile]. You can also find me on twitter
at [@scrabsha][twitter-profile] too. Finally, you can send me a mail at
[sasha.pourcelot@protonmail.com][mail].

[github-profile]: https://github.com/scrabsha
[twitter-profile]: https://twitter.com/scrabsha
[mail]: mailto:sasha.pourcelot@protonmail.com

I enjoy writing static analysis tools or macros.

I have done some very small contributions to the Rust compiler and written Rust
tools such as [cargo-breaking].

I am the primary author of the following Rust crates:
  - [cargo-breaking],
  - [dep-doc],
  - [cargo-abcr] (as part of the *A better `cargo-readme`* series),

[cargo-breaking]: https://github.com/iomentum/cargo-breaking
[dep-doc]: https://github.com/scrabsha/dep-doc
[cargo-abcr]: https://github.com/scrabsha/cargo-abcr

If you're interested in my work and want to discuss with me about it, or about
anything else, feel free to send me a direct message on Twitter.
